# Who is this for?
As of right now, August 15, 2025, this is for my lab report for 2nd semester CPP programming language.
All of the code here is free to use by anyone but it most likely isn't optimized to be the best at its work.

# Why share this?
I used to keep all my coding files into my hard disk, but the hard disk got damaged and I lost all my files. 
It's not super important to me so I'm not going to go recover it. 
This is just me sharing my progress in github while also learning the ins and outs of using git in cmd/nvim.

# What is in this repo?
As I said this is my files for lab report, I've indexed them according to the serial number but you can find the question in the file in documentation.
Sooner or later, I'm going to organize this repo to contain more sophisticated codes but for now its only my 2nd sem lab report repository, written as of Aug 15, 2025.

# What should you expect to see in the future?
My goal with this repository is to share my wins or learnings
- for the lab reports it will be normal with no comments in between
- for my codes you can expect to see multiple comments everywhere to understand how or why I wrote the code and what my thought process was at the moment of developing it
## Plans
- To create a project based learning system for CPP language (for now) and other languages as I learn how it would be easy for someone to learn with trial and error.
- Sooner or later I'm going to make a coding learning youtube channel and blogpost so I'm preparing my repositories for that cause.

# Timeline
As a student in Engineering course, this is an ambitious project, I don't have a clear vision or goal, I just want to create a learning system for others.
So atleast until the 2nd sem finals, September 11th 2025, this repository will only be for lab report writing and coding practice.

- August 15 -> September 11
    - There will be minimal or even no updates, programming is my strong subject so I'm not going to see it often.
- September 11 -> November 1
    - Most proactive phase
    - By this time you will see all 20 lab reports completed.
    - The plans will be in motion, I'll be making the system first in git then I'll have some of my friend try it out to see how it is.
        - Some of my planned to add projects are:
        - Simple menu driven calculator
        - Simple quiz game
        - Menu driven registration/login device using file handling
- November 1 onwards
    - By this time I'll be delving into DSA, so this repository will be inactive until further notice.

Thus, as of now, This might be the last update in the readme file or in this whole repository. I wish the you, the reader, best of luck with your endeavors.
